# Scientific-Calculator-Android-App-

🤖 Features of My Scientific Calculator:

Basic Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide! It's got all the essentials, so you can finally settle that debate about whether 2 + 2 really equals 4. (Spoiler: it does! 😂)

Advanced Functions: Trigonometry, anyone? Sin, Cos, Tan—your math teachers would be so proud! 📐

Modulo & Remainder: Yes, the % button does the remainder, not the percentage! (Because who doesn’t love a good math pun? 🤷‍♂️)

Brackets: Now you can show off your order of operations skills. Parentheses for the win! 🎉

Clear & Delete: Made a mistake? Just hit the clear button like you’re clearing your browser history! (We all know that feeling! 😂)

Dynamic Expression Editing: Change your mind mid-calculation? No problem! Just edit your expression and let the calculator work its magic! ✨
